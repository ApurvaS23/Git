Hello everyone 
How are you ?
Lets learn some concepts of machine learning.
Linear Regression 
Logistic Regression 
"Power BI" and "MySQL Queries"
SQL Queries -->>
Basic Queries (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY)
Aggregating Data (COUNT, SUM, AVG, GROUP BY)
Joining Tables (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.)
Inserting/Updating/Deleting Data (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
Creating Tables or Databases (CREATE DATABASE, CREATE TABLE)

1. Subquery in SELECT Clause
A subquery can be used to return a value in the SELECT clause.

Example: Get the employee name along with the highest salary in the company.
SELECT name, (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees) AS highest_salary
FROM employees;
This query will return the name of each employee and the highest salary in the company for each employee (though the result will be the same value for all rows).

Git -Basic Git Commands:
git init
Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

git status
Shows the current status of the working directory and staging area, including changes that are staged, modified, or untracked.
